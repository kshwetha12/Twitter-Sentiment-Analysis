# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Created a sentimental analysis report based on data collected from tweets to determine polarity and subjectivity of each tweet by using Twitter application program interface (API).
Investigated the data by splitting tweets into rows and checked for the most used character or word.
Performed an analysis to determine the number of nouns,verbs in the tweets using Python text blobs.
